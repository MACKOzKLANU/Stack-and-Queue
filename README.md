# Stack and Queue Implementation in C++

This C++ program demonstrates the implementation of a Stack and a Queue using linked lists.

## Overview

- The `Node` class represents a single node in both the Stack and the Queue.
- The `Stack` class implements basic stack operations such as push, pop, and display.
- The `Queue` class implements basic queue operations such as enqueue, dequeue, and display.

## Instructions

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. The program will demonstrate the functionality of both the stack and the queue.

## Features

### Stack

- `push(int v)`: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- `pop()`: Removes the element from the top of the stack.
- `operator-=(int amount)`: Removes multiple elements from the top of the stack.
- `size()`: Returns the size of the stack.
- `display()`: Displays the elements of the stack.

### Queue

- `Enqueue(int v)`: Adds an element to the end of the queue.
- `Dequeue()`: Removes an element from the front of the queue.
- `Display()`: Displays the elements of the queue.
- `Sum()`: Calculates the sum of all elements in the queue.
- `Includes(int v)`: Checks if a certain value exists in the queue.

## Usage

1. Create instances of `Stack` and `Queue`.
2. Use the provided functions to manipulate the stack and the queue.
3. View the results to observe the behavior of the data structures.
